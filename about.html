Mayday espanol - About Us <br>
Mayday Group <br>

From humble beginnings in 1972, our Founders built a dream imbibed with a deep respect for nature and community that lives in our DNA. Behind the company is a beautiful history of families, friendship and the power of will uniting to create Kenya's leading, independently owned, exceptional breed of hotels and resorts.

As a historic part of Kenya's hospitality industry, over decades we have acquired a portfolio of
                   exceptional properties. Mayday espanol houses eight unique properties in prime locations, each harmoniously individual to its own history and environment, fortified by a vision to impact surrounding communities and build a sustainable future.

                   ritage hotel to a colorful display of modern Africa, a lush tropical beach escape spread across 22 acres through to the adventures within our Safari Lodges, tucked across Kenyaâ€™s main National Parks and Conservancies.

Our experiences are built to bring you the marvels of Africa,
                   the wonders of nature, exquisite cuisine, and our undeniably refreshing hospitality.</p>
